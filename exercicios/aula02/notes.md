# Type="form" only makes a difference with we are sending data to a web server

# Css pseudo classe, EVERYTHING THAT COMES AFTER A : is a pseudo class

# it is used to modify certain aspects only after a certain event happens for ex:

# .formcontainer:hover {

# cursor: pointer;

# }

# when we hover our mouse on something that is part of the .formcontainer the cursor will turn into a pointer

# !important
